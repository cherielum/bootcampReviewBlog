    <h1> Coding Boot Camp- Things I wish I had done </h1>
    <h2 class = "subtitles"> Christmas Edition. </h2>

    <p class="animated slideInLeft">Ever since I was born, I have been surrounded by technology. If I'm a millenial, then I am around the beginning of it and do not embody what it means to be a stereotypical millenial today. I have experienced life without color televisions, cellphones, and have gone camping without electricity. I grew up during a time where people got bored, and asked parents "are we there yet?" not "can I have my ipad4" when I was 2. I am so fascinated by how technology has grown and when I moved to Atlanta, GA, I decided to follow my fascination.</p>

    <p class="animated slideInRight"> In August of 2017, I quit my job in banking and decided to follow my dreams in technology by joining a boot camp in Atlanta. How has it been??? So far, it has been great. I will officially graduate in February 2018 and I'm super excited to take my skills for a "real" test drive. </p>

    <p class="animated slideInLeft"> Months are funny. They seem to feel like a long time, and when you're reflecting upon them, they seem to have gone by. That is how I feel, like time has flown by! I opted for the part-time program which means that I only really get to see my teachers about 10 hours a week as opposed to 8-4 for five days a week. I knew from the beginning that I would have to put in personal hours into my coding life otherwise, this whole boot camp thing was going to be a waste. </p>

    <p class="animated slideInRight">With the understanding that nobody can full understand 5-6 languages within 3 or 6 months, I started coding every day. For me, my sites did not have to be amazingly blown out of the water daily, but a practice of sitting down, coding, and becoming more confident in learning. Bootcamps are about learning a lot of things quickly and being able to adopt. I definitely did and do that. I have also gained more confidence by what I did not do in the classroom. </p>

    <p class="animated slideInLeft">If I had to do this all over again, or talk to someone who just joined a boot camp, it would be say, 
        <ol>
            <li><b>Code every day and practice just sitting to code.</b> It took me about 30 days to really feel like I could make anything on my own and truly understand HTML/CSS syntax. </li>
            <li><b>Develop in languages don't understand but are curious about.</b> I started dabbling into c# and HTML5 Canvas towards the end of my course, but it might have been easier to learn code if I started doing what I seemed to like coding sooner. </li>
            <li><b>Network from day one. </b>If there's one thing that I appreciated doing it has been to network. Sometimes it seems worthless because the people you meet might flake out on you, but the reality of it is that the more people you meet, the more likely you'll me someone awesome. </li>
            <li><b>Do practice sites from Youtube, FreeCodeCamp, Udemy, egghead.io, before you learn a language in class.</b> I find that it helps and allows you to ask good questions after you've digested a bit of the language. </li>
        </ol>   
    </p>

    <p class="animated slideInRight"> And that is basically it! If you want to switch careers, but cannot go to school for it due to finances, poor test taking abilities, or just to learn about the world of coding, I definitely encourage you to do it. However, do know you're going to have to put in a lot of time into it to get something great back--like a job, or the ability to make great sites/apps. You will be what you want. And that's the reality of it. Whatever it is, I believe in us and our future. Go Web Devs! </p>

    <p> Have a merry, merry Christmas, <br />
